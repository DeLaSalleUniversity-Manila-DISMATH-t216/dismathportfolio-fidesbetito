## Week 1:

* We were introduced to a new subject called, DISCRETE MATHEMATICS or DISMATH.

* This subject soon proved to be really challenging if it was not taken seriously when studying.

* I've learned that DISMATH deals with mathematical truth **only**.

* I learned about logical connectives as presented in the table:

| *Logical Symbol*  |  *Logical Operator* | *Logical Expression* | *Shorthand* | *Formula* | 
| :-----: |:-------:|:--------:| :-------: | :-----: |
| ¬ |Negation | val(¬p) = 1 - val(p) | not | ¬p |
| ∧ | Conjunction | val(p ∧ q) = min(val(p), val(q)) | and | p ∧ q |
| v | Disjunction | val(p v q) = max(val(p), val(q)) | or | p v q |
| ⊕ | Exclusive disjunction | if val(p)  not equal val(q) = 1 , otherwise  0 | xor |  p ⊕ q  ≡ (¬p ∧ q) v (p ∧ ¬q) |
| → | Conditional | if val(p)  ≤ val(q) = 1 , otherwise  0 | if, then | p → q ≡  ¬p v q |
| ↔ | Biconditional | if val(p) equals val(q) = 1 , otherwise  0 | iff |  p ↔ q ≡ (p → q) ∧ (q → p) |
