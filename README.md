## Week 1:

* We were introduced to a new subject called, DISCRETE MATHEMATICS or DISMATH.

* This subject soon proved to be really challenging if it was not taken seriously when studying.

* I've learned that DISMATH deals with mathematical truth **only**.

* I learned about logical connectives as presented in the table:

| *Logical Symbol*  |  *Logical Operator* | *Logical Expression* | *Shorthand* | *Formula* | 
| :-----: |:-------:|:--------:| :-------: | :-----: |
| ¬ | Negation | val(¬p) = 1 - val(p) | not | ¬p |
| ∧ | Conjunction | val(p ∧ q) = min(val(p), val(q)) | and | p ∧ q |
| v | Disjunction | val(p v q) = max(val(p), val(q)) | or | p v q |
| ⊕ | Exclusive Disjunction | if val(p)  not equal val(q) = 1 , otherwise  0 | xor |  p ⊕ q  ≡ (¬p ∧ q) v (p ∧ ¬q) |
| → | Conditional | if val(p)  ≤ val(q) = 1 , otherwise  0 | if, then | p → q ≡  ¬p v q |
| ↔ | Biconditional | if val(p) equals val(q) = 1 , otherwise  0 | iff |  p ↔ q ≡ (p → q) ∧ (q → p) |

* I learned how to test the verification of a statement by using TRUTH TABLES.

* I learned about IMPLICATION which gets confusing as more complicated expressions were presented.

* Lastly, I learned about PROPOSITIONAL LOGIC such as:
    - inverse of p→q which is ¬p → ¬q
    - converse of p→q which is q → p
    - contrapositive of p→q which is ¬q → ¬p

## Week 2:

* In this week, I was introduced to a new set of laws in mathematics called **LOGICAL EQUIVALENCES**:

|  **LAW**  |  **EQUIVALENCE**  |
| :------: | :-----------------------------: |
|  _Identity Laws_  |  p ∨ F ≡ T  ;;  p ∧ F ≡ T  |
|  _Domination Laws_  |  p ∨ T ≡ T  ;;  p ∧ F ≡ F  |
|  _Negation Laws_  |  p ∨ ¬p ≡ T  ;;  p ∧ ¬p ≡ F  |
|  _Double Negation Law_  |  ¬(¬p) ≡ p  |
|  _Idempotent Laws_  |  p ∨ p ≡ p  ;;  p ∧ p ≡ p  |
| _Distributive Laws_  |  p ∨ (q ∧ r) ≡ (p ∨ q) ∧ (p ∨ r)  ;;  p ∧ (q ∨ r) ≡ (p ∧ q) ∨ (p ∧ r)  |
|  _Commutative Laws_  |  p ∨ q ≡ q ∨ p  ;;  p ∧ q ≡ q ∧ p  |
|  _Associative Laws_  |  (p ∨ q) ∨ r ≡ p ∨ (q ∨ r)  ;;  (p ∧ q) ∧ r ≡ p ∧ (q ∧ r)  |
|  _De Morgan's Laws_  |  ¬(p ∧ q) ≡ ¬p ∨ ¬q  ;;  ¬(p ∨ q) ≡ ¬p ∧ ¬q  |
|  _Absorption Laws_  |  p ∨ (p ∧ q) ≡ p  ;;  p ∧ (p ∨ q) ≡ p  |

* Using logic, we were able to conclude that Superman does not exist!

* We were also able to prove that **p → q ≡ ¬p ∨ q** using a Truth Table and Logical Equivalences. 

* **Predicate Logic**, much like in the English language, is not only concerned with its relation to logic but also with their internal structure in terms of subject and predicate.
* **Propositional Logic** deals with propositions, _subject and predicate_, as a whole.
* **Quantifiers** indicate the generality of the open sentence in which a variable occurs.
    - Existential Quantifier - "there exists" - if and only if P(x) is true for at least one value of x in the domain.
    - Universal Quantifier - "then exists" - many mathematical statements assert that a property is true for all values of a variable in a particular domain.

## Week 3:

* The terminologies for **Rules of Inference** were introduced:
    - _Argument_ is a series of statements that end with a conclusion.
    - _Valid_ is the conclusion which must follow from the truth of the preceding statements or premises of the argument.
    - _Fallacy_ is the common form of incorrect reasoning which leads to invalid arguments. 

* The tools that can be used to prove statements are:
    - Truth table
    - Logical Equivalences
    - Quantifiers
    - Rules of Inference
    
|  **TYPE**  |  **RULE OF INFERENCE**  |  **TAUTOLOGY**  |
| -------: | :--------------: | :--------- |
| _Modus Ponens_ | p, p → q ∴ q | (p ∧ (p → q)) → q |
| _Modus Tollens_ | ¬q, p → q ∴ ¬p | (¬q ∧ (p → q)) → ¬p |
| _Hypothetical Syllogism_ | p → q, q → r ∴ p → r | ((p → q) ∧ (q → r)) → (p → r) |
